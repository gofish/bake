bake
====

Standalone GNU make file supporting "advanced" features such as:

* a build/ sub-directory (no repo pollution, fast clean)
* multiple build types (e.g. release/debug/profile/coverage)
* C/C++ dependency generation and compile flag detection
* support for protobuf/thrift code generation
* pluggable projects using the source directory hierarchy
* simple customization of build rules for each project
* non-recursive build rule inclusion (speedy make)

Get baked.
