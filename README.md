bake
====

Standalone GNU make script/file supporting:

* build types (e.g. release/debug built-in)
* build sub-directories (no repo pollution, fast clean)
* non-recursive rule inclusion (speedy make)
* automatic C/C++ dependency generation
* support for protobuf/thrift code generation
* simple syntax for project rule definition
* pluggable project hierarchy

Get baked.
